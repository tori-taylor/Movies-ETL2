# Movies-ETL2
## The purpose of this project was to create a process that takes new data from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data and transforms and loads them into existing tables. 

When necessary I used https://github.com/cedoula/Movies-ETL/blob/master/ETL_create_database.ipynb as reference for help with the code
